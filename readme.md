## About Project: 
  ![Technology Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Technology-HTML%20%7C%20CSS-green)
  ### This project is "assignment 10" of HTML, CSS module of [Full Stack Javascript Web Developer Bootcamp](https://ineuron.ai/course/Full-Stack-Javascript-Web-Developer) by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/c/HiteshChoudharydotcom) on [ineuron.ai](https://ineuron.ai/) platform. 
  
#### Requirement/Problem statement: 
- To convert a given design (PNG file attached at the end) into HTML, CSS code.
    - Flexbox/grid/external libraries/framework shouldn't be used.
    - Responsiveness is required.

#### Learnings/experiences from building this project:
- I took 6 hours to turn given design into code!
- Learnings from this project:
    - Developed stronger grip on CSS positioning (relative and absolute) while building and positioning line ending with dot associated with cards in project.
    - I always used little hit and trial to fix background image as per design. But during this project, using hit and trial and little bit of google searching, I got strong hold on handling images. Positioning them properly and precisely is what I learnt from this project.
    - We must consider height of elements or page also while writing media queries. Earlier I use to only focus on width and keep on writing media query. In this project, I accidently reduced height of window and boom, I found my page is breaking horribly. 
        - Writing media query seems like writing whole CSS again!
