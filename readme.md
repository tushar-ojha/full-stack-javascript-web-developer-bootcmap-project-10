## About Project:


Design given:
![Design](/Design.png)

- I took 6 hours to turn given design into code!

- Learnings from this project:
    - Developed stronger grip on CSS positioning (relative and absolute) while building and positioning line ending with dot associated with cards in project.
    - I always used little hit and trial to fix background image as per design. But during this project, using hit and trial and little bit of google searching, I got strong hold on handling images. Positioning them properly and precisely is what I learnt from this project.
    - We must consider height of elements or page also while writing media queries. Earlier I use to only focus on width and keep on writing media query. In this project, I accidently reduced height of window and boom, I found my page is breaking horribly. 
        - Writing media query seems like writing whole CSS again!
